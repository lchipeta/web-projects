    outside the entrance of a seedy looking, run down motel.
            
        He walks through the creaking front entrance and beckons you inside.
    You follow him in, and on entering the reception hall you see a corridor with eight rooms to
    to your left. The strange man walks over to the back door at the other end of the reception room
    as the entrance door slams shut behind you. A fear falls over you, deciding to leave, you
    try to open the front door you find it is jammed tight with no way of escaping.
            
        Asking the strange man that you wish to go he replies 'I am Norman Bates
    and you will never leave here alive!'. He stands blocking the only way out... the door
    at the other side of reception, panic sets in and the only options you have are to fight
    Norman or enter the corridor and try to find something in one of the motel rooms to help you.
