<p>Enthusiastic, determined, well organised mum of two who has 
   a keen interest in art and crafts. I have grown to love children's art
   since my son joined nursery. It's amazing what little ones can produce 
   on a sheet of paper within a short space of time and no advance planning.
   I think their imagination and creativity is beautiful, spontaneous and 
   out of this world. In my opinion, it deserves a bit more appreciation than
   just ending up on the fridge or their bedroom walls only to be discarded
   and forgotten when they hit the teenage years hence the birth of 'Tods 
   color splash'. A great way to share, educate, inspire and archive children's 
   early years work of art.
