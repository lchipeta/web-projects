 <p>
    I am a mum of two with a keen interest in art and crafts. I love 
    children's art. I think their imagination and creativity is amazingly and 
    surprisingly beautiful, spontaneous and out of this world.

    Children's art deserve a bit more appreciation than just ending up on the 
    fridge or their bedroom walls only to be discarded when they reach teenage years
    hence the birth of 'Tods color splash'. A great way to share, educate, inspire
    and archive children's early years work of art.
